<p>The second step in attaining the gift of the Holy Spirit according to Andrew Murray is to recognize that we may have the Holy Spirit. It is a privilege that has been granted to us through the gift of grace through Jesus. Murray states: "God wants every child of His to be a healthy Christian, but you cannot be a healthy Christian unless you are filled with Godâ€™s Spirit." In John 14:26, Jesus says "but the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you." The life that Jesus calls us to is one that we cannot accomplish, so He sent a helper to make it possible. This is a privilege, a gift, and a promise. We should receive it with open hands and gratitude. True gratitude receives a gift with full recognition that it is undeserved. We can confidently approach the throne of God and ask Him to fill us with His Spirit, knowing that He desires for us to live healthy and holy lives through the power that He freely provides.</p>
