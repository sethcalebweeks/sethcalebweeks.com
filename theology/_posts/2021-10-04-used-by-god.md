Some churches encourage their members to evaluate themselves in order to determine which spiritual gifts they may have. These assessments are even used to direct individuals to areas of service or training within the church. I have always considered myself as someone with the aptitude for teaching and technology and have volunteered for positions with those requisites.

By all means, we should serve God with whatever skills that He has given us, but God can use us in areas where we have no natural abilities of our own. In fact, when we limit our service to what we think we are good at, we choose to act in our own strength and constrain the power of God. He can and wants to use us in much greater ways than we could ever imagine. We must come to Him in full surrender, recognizing that we are entirely helpless and hopeless without the power of the Holy Spirit.
