In his book, Absolute Surrender, Andrew Murray makes the simple observation that branches do not produce fruit through strenuous work, but simply by abiding in the vine. As Christians, this means that the fruit that God has called us to produce can only be cultivated by remaining in Christ. Any attempt to produce fruit apart from Christ is futile, and we can be fruitful simply by abiding in Christ. In the words of Murray:

> If I am something, then God is not everything; but when I become nothing, God can become all, and the everlasting God in Christ can reveal himself fully. That is the higher life.

It is such a simple thought, and yet I often strive to produce fruit instead of simply resting in God's provision.
