It's been a while since I've written a blog post. I have been asking myself what my motivations would be to start blogging again. Sometimes I learn something so exciting that I want to tell anyone I can about. Other times I become passionate about a topic that compels me to add my two cents. The majority of the time, however, my objective is to organize my thoughts and reflections and process them methodically. Looking back through posts that I have written reminds me of where I came from, how God delivered me, and what He has taught me along the way. By exposing my ponderings, I hope that others will hold me accountable for my commitment to memory and be encouraged to explore this life that God has given us.
