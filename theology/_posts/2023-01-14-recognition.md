title: Recognition
---

At work yesterday, I was thinking about how to overcome my unhealthy desire for recognition. This craving manifests as jealousy, pride, and self-righteousness to the detriment of those around me.

C.S. Lewis suggested that we "are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists." What is the satisfaction of the desire for recognition? Could it be recognition from God?

Indeed, the fulfillment of this desire is recognition from God. But even this new awareness can be warped into a futile endeavor of trying to impress God with our own actions. God is only impressed by one thing: Himself. To be recognized by God, we must give up our self, and let the life of Jesus take full reign. Only then will we find the fulfillment of our desire for recognition.
