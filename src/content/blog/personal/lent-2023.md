As a protestant Christian, I've never observed Lent. But I decided to use the Lent season this year as an excuse to make some lifestyle changes. My goal is to give up watching any videos on YouTube or Facebook for the duration of Lent. Additionally, I'd like to avoid scrolling on Facebook, LinkedIn, HackerNews, or any other social or information platform.

I've recognized that I have an unhealthy attraction to distraction. My attention span is very short, and I am constantly filling my brain with useless content. Even when the things I am watching or reading are actually informational or useful, I am often just browsing to keep myself occupied or for the fear of missing out (FOMO).

With the time I gain from giving up these distractions, I plan to:
- Spend more intentional time with God
- Read more books, especially the many that I have started already
- Write more blog posts and livestream coding challenges
- Make progress on the numerous side projects I have started

There's no particular reason why I'm doing this for Lent. I'm not really sure what Lent is all about, but it gives me a reason to commit to.
