It is no surprise that I am very particular and strongly opinionated with regards to Christian doctrine. I think it is important to have a correct understanding of who God is and what His word says. Unfortunately, simple head knowledge isn't enough to transform my behavior, and trying to know the right answers can lead to self-righteousness and pride. The solution to this problem is not to be less dogmatic. On the contrary, I must be all the more firm on the doctrines of God's infinite incomprehensibility, my inadequacy to do anything good apart from Him, and the paramount importance of self-sacrificial love.
