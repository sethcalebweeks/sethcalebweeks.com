In grade school English classes, I was taught to avoid using generic descriptors such as good, bad, happy, or sad in my writing. Instead, I should use words like magnanimous, atrocious, elated, or dismal.

In the Bible, we are told to "taste and see that the Lord is good." There are many other suitable and elaborate words that we can use to describe God. But at the core of His character, He is good!

I think most people who reject God do so because they don't believe He is good. Even someone who rejects the existence of God does so because they think His existence would not be good. In a way, the first lie in the garden of Eden questioned the goodness of a God who would withhold knowledge, and ever since then, we have questioned His goodness.

In the midst of any confusing characteristics of God such as His triune nature, His sovereignty in predestination, or even the age-old question of why He would allow bad things happen to good people, we can take comfort in the unshakeable fact: God is good!
