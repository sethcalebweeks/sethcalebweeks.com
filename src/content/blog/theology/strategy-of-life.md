<p>I really enjoy strategy games. It occurred to me recently that I have been approaching life as a strategy game. After recent updates to my profession, housing situation, and parental status, some may evaluate a reasonable degree of success. In any strategy game, however, it is critical to define the objective. I believe that the objective of life is to know God and grow in our love for Him. How is this achieved? Ecclesiastes 12:13 tells us that our duty is to fear God and keep His commands. We begin by having a right understanding of who God is, and demonstrate our love for Him through obedience. We may have a perfect strategy, but if we have the objective wrong, we will certainly lose.</p>
