In <a href="https://sethcalebweeks.com/2021/06/10/meta-love/">Meta Love</a>, I claimed that the only way to truly love yourself is to be in a loving union with someone (specifically God). Well, it turns out that for married people, there is another way! Ephesians 5:28 says "In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself." This sounds oddly similar to the commandment to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, except this time, we are told how husbands can love themselves: by loving their wife! Marriage is actually a three-part union with God. It is the closest human union of the same sort that the Trinity is. I think this is a super cool concept! As a husband, I get to learn how to love myself by loving my wife. Then I can love my neighbor as I love myself.

If you're not already excited by this concept, wait until you read tomorrow's post! This same union has implications for how the body of Christ should engage with each other and the world. Stay tuned!

<em>PS. I am not claiming that loving your spouse is a substitute for being in a loving union with God. On the contrary, it is impossible to love anyone at all otherwise.</em>
