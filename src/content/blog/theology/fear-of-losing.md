For most of my life, I have always been restlessly awaiting the next stage in life. Currently, I have been enjoying life as it is, but there is a new plague that accompanied this contentful bliss. I am now afraid of losing what I have; of making a mistake or suffering a tragedy that rips away my more or less optimal life. This feeling has embodied the form of anxiety and stress, leading to loss of focus and physical tension. It is a difficult endeavor to hold on to this life loosely. We must store up treasure in heaven where we cannot lose it.
