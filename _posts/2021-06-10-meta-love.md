This is a republish of a post I wrote on May 4, 2016. Since this post, I have had more thoughts on this topic which I will be elaborating on in future posts.
<blockquote>If you have not read the post titled <a href="https://sethcalebweeks.com/2021/06/08/love-yourself/">Love Yourself</a>, make sure you do that before continuing to read this. Have you noticed how God always sets the example for us whenever He gives us a command to follow? God has commanded us to love others as we love ourselves. Implicit in this command is the idea that we have to love ourselves. Analogously, God’s love for us extends from the love that He has for Himself. This is quite a remarkable concept to comprehend. God does not need anything external to Himself to define His value or purpose. He has no need for anything from anyone. It is from this limitless love for Himself that He is able to love us through creating us and saving us from ourselves. “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10 ESV)</blockquote>
