I used to be more critical of worship songs that talk about how God never fails us. Musical worship to me meant declaring what God has done and responding in praise, but these songs seemed to superficially focus on this buddy relationship where God has our back. It is true that the fact that Jesus atoned for our sins is far more significant than a minor snag in life, but I forgot that the very same power that rose Jesus from the dead is available to me every moment through the Holy Spirit. My cynicism stems from a prideful self-reliance on my own strength and an inaccurate assumption that God has more important things to do. The reality is that I am desperately in need of the power of the Holy Spirit each moment, and I can take comfort inn the fact that God is concerned with the smallest detail of my life.
