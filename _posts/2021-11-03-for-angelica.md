Dearest Angelica,

Happy birthday! I am so grateful that God has given you life and has brought you into my life. I can't believe that we have known each other for five years already. You are truly a blessing to me, to Abigail, and to so many people. I admire your strength, gentleness, patience, and zeal, and you inspire me to grow in each of those areas.

Thank you for being such an amazing wife! You are truly the woman I need and want in my life. I am so blessed to be loved by you, and you make me feel more loved each day. Living with you is an absolute joy, and no matter what happens each day, I can find rest and comfort in coming home to you. Thank you for making me feel youthful while challenging me to become a better and more mature man.

Thank you for being such an awesome mother! Abigail is so blessed to have you as her mother, and I am looking forward to the day when she recognizes that for herself. Even though there are difficult periods of motherhood, you are always patient and loving. I am excited to see how you continue to parent our kids!

Thank you for your diligence and determination as an employee and in all the other areas where you serve. Your commitment and dedication are inspiring, and you put your whole heart into everything that you do. I love telling people about your latest accomplishments and about just how amazing of a person you are.

I love you so much! I am looking forward to celebrating many more birthdays with you and being with you in both the highs and lows. May God bless you richly with every blessing in the heavenly places. May He fill you with joy and peace and grant you strength for each moment. 

Love,
Caleb
