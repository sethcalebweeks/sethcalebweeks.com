This is a republish of a post I wrote on March 8, 2016:
<blockquote>W<span style="color:rgb(54,52,49); font-family:" librebaskerville",baskerville,"bookantiqua",georgia,times,serif; font-size:16px; font-style:normal; font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; font-weight:400; letter-spacing:normal; orphans:2text-indent:0px; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:rgb(250,249,245); text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; display:inline!important; float:none; text-align:left;">hen I present my problems to God, I often come to Him with a set of constraints or possible solutions which I hope He might help me with. Instead of laying everything before Him and letting Him pick up the shards of my life, I treat Him as a tool; a means to my own end. But God does not work according to the plans of man. He has broken me until I had nothing left of myself and restored me to new life in Him! “O Lord my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.” (Psalm 30:2)</span></blockquote>
