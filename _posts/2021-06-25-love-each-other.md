This is the second part of <a href="https://sethcalebweeks.com/2021/06/24/love-your-other-half/">Love Your Other Half</a>; the long-awaited sequel! (Not that long, but I'm excited for this one!) Ephesians 5:31-32 says: "'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church." The church shares the same union with Christ that a husband shares with his wife. Throughout the New Testament, the church is repetitively reminded to love one another as Christ loves the church. Jesus tells his disciples in John 13:35 "by this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.‚Äù Just as we need to love ourselves before we love our neighbors, how God loves Himself before he loves us, how spouses love each other before they love other people, the church must love each other before they love people outside the church. As Christians, we are called to love the other members of the body. How can we take care of people in need in the world if our own body is not healthy (or even fighting against itself)? We should focus on loving our brothers and sisters in Christ before we reach out to the world.
