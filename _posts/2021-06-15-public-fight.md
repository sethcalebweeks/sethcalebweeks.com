<p>The world watches as Christians strive to live holy lives. We may not always reflect the image of God, but they notice when we put up a good fight. There are many people who try to be generally moral people but for various motives. They may be attempting to win favor with others or themselves or even God as they understand Him to be. But Christians pursue righteousness in obedience to God to demonstrate their love for Him in grateful response to His salvation. When we fail to accurately represent Him, He convicts us of sin and graciously draws us back to Himself. If you have taken a few blows to your spiritual devotion, keep fighting! The world is watching.</p>
