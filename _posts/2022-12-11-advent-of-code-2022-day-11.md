### Highlights

- I spent way too much time at the beginning trying to be clever about parsing the input. The Regex named captures work great, but I also tried to dynamically create the functions using metaprogramming. Eventually I gave up on that and hard-coded the function combinations.
- After constructing three neat layers of reduces for the rounds, monkeys, and items, I realized that the state needed to be modified within the round so that monkeys could throw to other monkeys coming later in the round. This is a prime example where a functional paradigm is actually less intuitive. I saw that [one person](https://elixirforum.com/t/advent-of-code-2022-day-11/52423?u=weeksseth) on the Elixir forum used GenServers, which is a perfect way of thinking about state a little more procedurally. I opted for smushing the round and monkey reduces into a single reduce so that they could share the same accumulator.
- Admittedly, I did not figure out the trick to the second part on my own. My brain was headed in the correct direction, but I didn't really want to spend my time figuring out a math problem. (Usually, I love doing math, but my primary goal has been to keep up with these Advent of Code problems.)
