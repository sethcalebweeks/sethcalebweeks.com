<p>A lot of my time is spent coming up with definitions of things. As a solutions architect, my job involves defining all the components of a system and how they will interact with each other. My fascination with functional programming and category theory leads me down a rabbit hole of declarative programming and mathematical abstraction. I approach theology and doctrine with the same appreciation for precision. Imprecise definitions lead to misunderstanding and misuse. The way that something is defined affects the way it relates to other things. For the sake of filling out this blog post, we could use the example of how our identity affects the way we relate to God and to others. Tomorrow, I will be writing about what the gifts and the fruit of the Spirit are. See you then!</p>
