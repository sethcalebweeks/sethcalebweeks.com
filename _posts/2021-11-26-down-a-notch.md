I am so thankful to have a wife who is willing and able to challenge me and encourage me to grow as a husband, father, and follower of Christ. Last night, Angelica had a dream where she confronted me regarding my arrogance in the way I talked. Even with the risk of offending me, she decided to act on her dream and point out recent occasions where I was prideful or belittling of others. Sadly, there are many times where I do not even realize how my words exalt myself at the expense of others or the misappropriation of God's glory. This post is a reminder to myself to put on humility and guard my tongue, and a request for your prayers that I may have a servant heart and a gentle spirit.
