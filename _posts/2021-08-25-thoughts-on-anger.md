I have been thinking a lot about the root issues of my predominant sins lately. Anger continually seems to control me instead of the other way round. I am easily bothered by how other people around me act, even if they aren't affecting me. There are possible a few reasons why this is the case. Firstly, I defend my own reactions and thoughts through rationalization. I look for reasons why it is okay for me to be upset, perhaps because of some moral infringement on their part. Secondly, in comparing myself to others, I think that I am better than them. I conclude that since I am right and they are wrong, they don't deserve to be treated with the same love and respect that I think I deserve. Thirdly, I am blind to the fact that I am in need of as much grace if not more from God because of the terrors of my own sin. I easily forget the price that Jesus paid for my sins and that He has bought me with His own blood. Lastly, I usurp God's rule and reign over the situation by believing that it is within my control or domain.

In response to these conclusions, my aim is to:
<ul>
 	<li>Constantly reflect on the depravity of my sin and the richness of God's grace</li>
 	<li>Be grateful and content in all circumstances</li>
 	<li>Lament over the sin of those around me and pray for their salvation</li>
 	<li>Prioritize being loving and respectful over being right</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Will you pray for me that God will transform me and rid me of this anger?
