It is difficult to watch my wife suffer through the pain of carrying a child in her womb. I have the opportunity to experience second-hand the analogy that Jesus uses to describe the suffering Christians will face in the end times. Sometimes, life can throw so many difficult situations at us that we'd rather just go home to be with God. Paul certainly felt that way (Philippians 1:23). But just as Angelica and I are looking forward to the day when we get to meet our baby girl face to face, we can look forward to the day when we get to meet Jesus face to face! It will all be worth the wait when that day comes!
